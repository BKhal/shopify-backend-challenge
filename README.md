# Shopify Intern Backend Challenge Summer 2022

This is a simple web application created using Ruby on Rails for tracking inventory. You can create, edit, list, or delete products and their quantities.

The application also allows you to download the product data as a CSV file.

## Running the Application

The application can be accessed at the following url: [https://bkhal.github.io/shopify-backend-challenge/](https://bkhal.github.io/shopify-backend-challenge/)

Alternatively, in order to run the application locally, make sure to have the following installed on your machine:

* Ruby (ver. 3.0.1)
* Rails (ver. 6.1.4.4)
* SQLite (ver. 3.31.1)

Next, follow these steps:

1. Clone project files from GitHub.
2. Navigate to folder in command terminal and run `rails server`.
3. Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser.

You should now be able to see the inventory landing page, from where you can create new products, manage the ones that have already been created, and export the data to a CSV file.
